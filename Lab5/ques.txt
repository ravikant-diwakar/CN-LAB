Lab – 5 - Socket Programming – Sequential - Chat Server - Multithreading

 Aim of the experiment:
1. Discuss how to design a Sequential Chat Server.
 Assignment
 Write a connection-oriented client and server socket program using C where the server
will behave as a chat server serving multiple chat clients but one at a time. When the chat
server receives a “bye” message from a particular client then it terminates the respective
connection with that client.
